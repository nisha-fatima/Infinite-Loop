            You are sacrificing to prove how strong you believe that blockchains are speech and speech is a protected human right.This is an important political statement.You must have no expectation of profit from the work of others.The set of people who have sacrificed to show their commitment to this political statement makes a great set of people to airdrop free things to.This sacrifice points are not meant to have any monetary value.Remember, you're not buying anything, the world is just noticing you are amongst a group of people that sacrificed to make a political statement. Some countries tax their citizens when they receive things of value. IKE designed to start with no value, which is ideal. Consult your own legal and financial professionals, as nothing written here should be considered professional advice. The only thing we know of set to be airdropped for free to this political group so far is IKE (IKE.) If we hear about other cool things, we'll let you know.
